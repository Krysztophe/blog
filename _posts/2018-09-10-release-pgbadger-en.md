<!--MORE-->


This release of pgBadger is a major release that adds some new features and fix all issues reported by users since last release. Every one should upgrade.


  * Add support of pgbouncer syslog log file format.
  * Add support to all auto_explain format (text, xml, json and yaml).
  * Add support to %q placeholder in log_line_prefix.
  * Add jsonlog format of Michael Paquier extension, with -f jsonlog
    pgbadger will be able to parse the log.
  * Replace the SQL formatter/beautify with v3.0 of pgFormatter.


There is some new command line options:

  - Add --prettify-json command line option to prettify JSON output.
  - Add --log-timezone  +/-XX  command line option to set the number
    of hours from GMT of the timezone that must be used to adjust
    date/time read from log file before beeing parsed. Note that you
    might still need to adjust the graph timezone using -Z when the
    client has not the same timezone.
  - Add --include-time option to add the ability to choose times that
    you want to see, instead of excluding all the times you do not
    want to see (--exclude-time).
